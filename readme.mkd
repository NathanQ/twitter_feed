# Twitter Feed

The Twitter Feed is another way to pull Twitter data to create a json file on your website. Twitter Feed was made in response to Twitter's retirement of API v1 which worked great to pull in a user's timeline.

The Twitter Feed app uses [Django], [Python Memcached], [Tweepy], and Twitter's OAuth Tool Settings ([Twitter App] required) to access Twitter. The app caches the results so Twitter's rate limitations should not be a problem.
